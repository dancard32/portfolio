            Flowbite is an open-source library of UI components built with the
            utility-first classes from Tailwind CSS. It also includes
            interactive elements such as dropdowns, modals, datepickers.

            <br />
            Before going digital, you might benefit from scribbling down some
            ideas in a sketchbook. This way, you can think things through before
            committing to an actual design project.

            But then I found a{" "}
            <a href="https://flowbite.com">
              component library based on Tailwind CSS called Flowbite
            </a>
            . It comes with the most commonly used UI components, such as
            buttons, navigation bars, cards, form elements, and more which are
            conveniently built with the utility classes from Tailwind CSS.
            <br />
            <br />
            First of all you need to understand how Flowbite works. This library
            is not another framework. Rather, it is a set of components based on
            Tailwind CSS that you can just copy-paste from the documentation.
